# IDP-GROUP-11

As mentioned on my CV, this is the integrated design project as part of my Cambridge Engineering course.

A link to the task can be found here https://jaehughes.github.io/IDPDocs/.

The `robot_cpp_file.ino` and `robot.h` files define the robot class and the void loop used by the arduino in the competition.

The `main.py` and `main-camera.py` files were planned to be used to navigate the robot using the camera,
however we did not use these in the end as we did not have enough time to implement successfully.

`Sensor-testing.ino` used for testing all interrupts and sensors are working correctly.
