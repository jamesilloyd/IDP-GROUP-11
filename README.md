# IDP-GROUP-11

The robot.cpp and robot.h files define the robot class and the void loop used by the arduino in the competition.

main.py and main-camera.py were planned to be used to navigate the robot using the camera,
however we did not use these in the end as we did not have enough time to test successfully.
